Project : Kandinsky_API.

This project is an experiment aimed at creating API requests to an open GAN (developed by the "Fusion Brain" team). 
The project consists of two key files: Imagegenerator and widget.
Imagegenerator describes a class responsible for forming API requests and processing responses, 
while widget contains an interface through which users can input data for the requests.

The project is currently in development. 
The first part, which involves configuring the requests, has been completed, 
and work is now underway to develop a simple and user-friendly interface. 
The final product will be a small application that can be integrated into a larger project.

The project is built on the Qt framework.
